  # An InvalidTimezoneIdentifier error is raised when a DATETIME property with an invalid timezone is
  # involved in a timezone conversion operation
  #
  # Rather than attempting to detect invalid timezones immediately the detection is deferred to avoid problems
  # such as importing a calendar which has forward reference to VTIMEZONE components.
